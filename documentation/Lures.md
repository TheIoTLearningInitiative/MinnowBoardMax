Lures
==

> MinnowBoard Lure Daughter cards are provided separately. They can be custom developed to expose features and interfaces as required for developer applications. They are “stackable” up to a depth of four devices.

> Breakout boards called "Lures" expand functionality of the MinnowBoard MAX by connecting to either the low- or high-speed expansion connectors. Lures are owned and supported by their respective owners and manufacturers. The community can give you best effort support; issues should be taken to the respective manufacturers and designers.
